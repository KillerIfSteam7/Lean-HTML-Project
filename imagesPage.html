    Did You See That Banana Image Near The Header Text?
    <br>
    HTML Can Display Images Using An [img] Tag
    <br>
    And Also It Can Resize Them With Width/Height
    <br>
    Attribute For Example A 1024px Image Can Be
    <br>
    Resized To 32px By Typing [Width:32px, Height:32px]
    <br>
    The Following Image Is Orignally 1920px But
    <br>
    <br>
    It's Resized To Fit The Website A Little Bit : 
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="Nature_0.jpg" alt="Nature0" width:256px; height:128px;>
